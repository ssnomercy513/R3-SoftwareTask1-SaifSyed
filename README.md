I begun by struggling to code the 7 segment display because no matter how I'd wire this project it wouldn't power on
I was able to look up schmatics online and place the pins where they needed to be
In tinkercad it was relatively easy to look at the pins and connect them where they needed to go
from there I did some tests by running through all the numbers individually using a for loop
after that I used some code online to allow the potentiometer to range only from 0-100 when looking at the input
using this value I was then able to display it on the 7 segment display
